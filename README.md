## Dependencies

-   cmake >= 3.5
-   All OSes:  [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
-   make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)
    -   Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
    -   Mac:  [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
    -   Windows:  [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
-   gcc/g++ >= 5.4
    -   Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
    -   Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](([https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/))
    -   Windows: recommend using  [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
-   [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
    -   Run either  `./install-mac.sh`  or  `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
    -   If you install from source, checkout to commit  `e94b6e1`, i.e.
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
        cd uWebSockets
        git checkout e94b6e1
        
        ```
        
        Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See  [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3)  for more details.
-   Simulator. You can download these from the  [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)  in the classroom.


## Basic Build Instructions

1.  Clone this repo.
2.  Make a build directory:  `mkdir build && cd build`
3.  Compile:  `cmake .. && make`
4.  Run it:  `./pid`

## Code

### Tuning

The tuning of the PID was made in an empiric way, as described by the Zieglerâ€“Nichols tuning method. It is performed by setting the integral (Ki) and derivative gains to zero. The proportional gain, Kp, is then increased (from zero) until it reaches a "relatively" stable and consistent oscillations, even if the car was still leaving the road after some time when the road's bend is too curved.

By twiddling the parameters (first D and then I), the different values for the PID gains that were chosen are:
- Kp = 0.15
- Ki = 0.002
- Kd = 3.0

### Inputs/Outputs

The simulator provides to our program some inputs using JSON messages:
- Cross track error (cte)
- Steering angle (steering_angle)
- Vehicle's speed (speed)

After updating the error, the PID returns:
- Steering angle (steering_angle)
- Throttle (throttle), which is constant in our case.
